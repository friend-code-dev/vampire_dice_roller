 * For each level of Hunger affecting a vampire character (up to a maximum 5), they gain one
 * Hunger die. Hunger dice are ten-sided, just like regular dice. When a player
 * builds a dice pool for a vampire character, they exchange regular dice from that pool for Hunger
 * dice on a one-for-one basis.
 *
 * If the dice pool for the roll is lower than the characterâ€™s Hunger, simply roll a number of
 * Hunger dice equal to the dice pool.
 *
 * The exception: Characters never include Hunger dice in Checks, Willpower, or Humanity dice
 * pools.
